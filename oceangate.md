## **Titan Implosion Case Study**

<br />

## **Problem** - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_submersible_implosion)

> On 18 June 2023, Titan, a submersible operated by American tourism and expeditions company OceanGate, imploded during an expedition to view the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. On board the submersible were Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate; Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French deep sea explorer and Titanic expert; Hamish Harding, a British billionaire businessman; Shahzada Dawood, a Pakistani-British billionaire businessman; and Dawood's son Suleman.
>
> Communication with Titan was lost 1 hour 45 minutes into its dive. Authorities were alerted when it failed to resurface at the scheduled time later that day. After the submersible had been missing for four days, a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) discovered a debris field containing parts of Titan, about 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bow of the Titanic. The search area was informed by the United States Navy's (USN) sonar detection of an acoustic signature consistent with an implosion around the time communications with the submersible ceased, suggesting the pressure hull had imploded while Titan was descending, resulting in the instantaneous deaths of all five occupants.
>
> The search and rescue operation was conducted by an international team led by the United States Coast Guard (USCG), USN, and Canadian Coast Guard. Support was provided by aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force and United States Air National Guard, a Royal Canadian Navy ship, as well as several commercial and research vessels and ROVs.
> 
> Numerous industry experts had raised concerns about the safety of the vessel. OceanGate executives, including Rush, had not sought certification for Titan, arguing that excessive safety protocols and regulations hindered innovation.

## **Analysis**
- **Talk Straight**
    - Did the inclusion of "experimental" verbiage in the waiver to enter the vessel constitute talking straight (especially while mentioning death 3 times on the same page)?
    - Would knowing this vessel had successfully submersed prior increase or decrease your chances of entering the vessel?
- **Demonstrate Respect**
    - How would you have responded to the allegations of an  improperly built vessel if you were Rush?
    - Was floating a vessel knowing it was cutting corners a lack or respect to the occupants? Should the occupants have trusted Rush as much as they did?
- **Create Transparency**
    - If Rush had more clearly explained that his ship was using a material that was known to fail at high pressures, would anyone have gotten in his ship?
    - Will this lack of transparency cause more regulation in the submersible industry?
- **Right Wrongs**
    - If Rush had not settled with the person that made the allegation of his shoddy and unsafe, and made ***some*** adjustments to the ship's integrity-might the occupants have made a successful voyage?
- **Show Loyalty**
    - Do the agencies that search for missing people have an obligation to search for said people when the mission was carried out under the most dubious auspices?
    - Should someone that knew Rush have pulled him aside and told him to not carry on with the "mission"
- **Deliver Results**
    - Would a successful mission have led to Rush cutting even more corners?
    - Was the main result Rush chased just notoriety and fame?
- **Get Better**
    - Will this lead to more/the same/or less danger tourism?
- **Confront Reality**
    - Should a government agency have stepped in and stopped the "mission"? Did anyone owe Rush this "courtesy"?
    - Would you ever have gotten in the sub?
- **Clarify Expectations**
    - Would having the sub be stamped as safe down to 12,500 ft (depth of Titanic) have made you feel better about the safety of the vessel?
    - If you were a person that put down the deposit, and you heard these allegations of a lack of safety, what could have clarified your expectation that the vessel would be safe upon departure?
- **Practice Accountability**
    - James Cameron (who has made the dive 30+ times) said that as soon as he heard of the material being used he knew the vessel was doomed. Should he have practiced "see something say something" in a more vocal way given his large voice and influence?
    - Should the researchers have also done the same thing?
- **Listen First**
    - How did a lack of listening to people come to play in this story?
- **Keep Commitments**
    - Can OceanGate or any other sub company set sail again or is all trust eroded in the industry?
- **Extend Trust**
    - Who can/should extend trust in this situation and why?

## **Results & Next Steps**

OceanGate suspended operations indefinitely after the loss of life. The US and Canadian governmental agencies related to this incident are conducting their own investigations. Rush's desire to exemplify start-up culture and "fail fast" ultimately lead to the loss of his life and 4 others. OceanGate will most likely never operate again and has lost trust completely within the industry and potentially marred the industry's reputation irreparably.
