## **Wells Fargo Case Study**

#### *Or how trust was lost one account at a time*

## **Problem** - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_account_fraud_scandal)

Wells Fargo created millions of fraudulent savings and checking accounts in between 2011 and 2016. [Cross-selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-selling) was the main technique used to create the fraudulent accounts. Upper management set unrealistic goals (20 cross sells a day) which in turn was met with dread and suffering on the part of the banking employees. The employees used a technique called "pinning" where they zeroed out the pin numbers in order to gain the ability to access the accounts easily. They also used their own address information so as not to tip off the customers about the undesired and illegal behavior occurring against their accounts. There were several complaints internally from staff but many of them went unheaded. From 2016 onward, the scandal cost them in upwards of $3 billion and untold amounts of trust. The CEO, John Stumpf, resigned reluctantly after a senate investigation and his replacement resigned as well due to his alleged involvement.

## **Results & Next Steps**

Wells Fargo has yet to make a plan to ameliorate their wrongdoing other than to keep paying fines. Numerous cities and states have either suspended using their services or cut ties altogether. Hubris and greed lead to a breach of trust which sent them into a spiraling tailspin. In days since their first fine, they have been fighting an uphill battle both in a pecuniary sense. Their journey of rebuilding trust will be ongoing for the near and potentially long term future.
